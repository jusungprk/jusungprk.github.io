                        <h2>About Me</h2> 
                        <p>I am a second-year student attending Dartmouth College pursuing a major in Computer Science and Neuroscience. 
                            I'm from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and my main interests include dancing and cooking.</p> 
                        <p>I am new to frontend development, but it is something I have always been interested in and I know elementary HTML and CSS. 
                            I have extensive experience in Python, Java, C, C++, and Linux/Unix. 
                            I am excited to work with DALI because I believe DALI will first and foremost grant opportunities for me to grow and thrive as a developer, 
                            become more experienced with applications and tools within technical engineering and gain a sense of working for and with clients for real-world applications and projects. 
                            The community of seasoned mentors and upperclassmen provide an environment of growth that I can't access anywhere else of campus and I would love to grow by being a part of DALI.</p>

                            <p>C++, Arduino</p>
                            <p>Automated a T-maze apparatus using Arduinos and C++ that facilitates mice research for undergoing a texture discrimination task with minimal human interference and standardized results.
                                Implemented Plexiglass, Servo Motors, Stepper Motors, IR break-beam sensors, and 3-D printed models specialized to mice behavioral patterns and simulate an appropriate environment for the rodents.

                            <p>Developed a pathfinder program utilizing breadth-first search binary tree algorithms with backchaining and breadcrumb search to optimize path search to a certain destination from an origin.
                                Achieved an interactive road map of Dartmouth College's campus through translating coordinates into vertices and animated the map to visualize the breadth-search display process unfold graphically.
